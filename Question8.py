# Q8. Can Ridge Regression be used for time-series data analysis? If yes, how?

# Ridge Regression can be used for time-series data analysis, but it may not be the most suitable choice for all time-series modeling tasks. Ridge Regression is primarily designed for cross-sectional data, where observations are independent of each other.

# Stationarity: Time-series data often require the assumption of stationarity, which means that statistical properties of the data (such as mean and variance) remain constant over time.

# When using Ridge Regression for time-series data, feature engineering is crucial. You may need to create lagged variables (using past values as predictors) to capture the temporal relationships.

# If you choose to apply Ridge Regression to time-series data, it's essential to use time-based cross-validation techniques, such as time series cross-validation or rolling origin validation
